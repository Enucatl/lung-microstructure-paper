The radiographies on the laboratory source were taken on a symmetric
Talbot-Lau interferometer (see fig.~\ref{248327}) with a grating pitch of 5.4 μm and an intergrating
distance of 26 cm, the phase-shift grating provides a phase shift of $\pi$
at 45 keV. The average visibility of the interference pattern without any
sample is 14\%. The source is a Comet MXR-225/26 X-ray tube operated at 100
kV and 6 mA. The source size is 1 mm. The detector is a prototype based on
Santid CdTe by Dectris Ltd. The CdTe 750 μm sensor provides high quantum
efficiency at high energies (>90\% at 60 keV) with a pixel size of 75 x 75
μm$^2$. The phase-stepping procedure was performed with 31 phase steps with
1 s exposure per step.
