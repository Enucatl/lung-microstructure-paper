\section{Results and discussion}\label{sec:results}
The section of the radiographic image of each lung sample is manually
matched to the local tomography, as identified during the alignment of the
tomographic scan. The average and standard deviation of the $R$ values are
calculated and plotted in fig.~\ref{206272} (black dots and errorbars). The expected
values according to eq.~\ref{eqn:totalsum} are calculated with the inputs from the
microtomographic datasets, as described in section~\ref{sec:tomoprocessing}, and are plotted on
fig.~with red dots for each sample.
