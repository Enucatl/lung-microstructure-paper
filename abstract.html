<div>A wide range of pulmonary diseases affect the lungs microstructure, i.e. the alveolar epithelium, where diffusion-driven gas exchange takes place.&nbsp; Thereby, early and definite diagnosis is not only important to prevent treatment delays, but also to counteract  acute exacerbation and initiate treatment before reaching an irreversible state. In a number of works, dark-field grating interferometry has been identified as the most promising technique in the screening of disease-induced changes to the lungs microstucture, most importantly in the early diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema when compared to traditional transmission radiography. Thereby, the dependency of the dark-field signal on the mean alveolar size could In this work, we show a quantitative model for dark-field radiography on a laboratory source, starting from first principles and a ground truth provided by microscopic tomography of the same samples. This provides a deeper understanding of dark-field imaging that can be beneficial for the design of an interferometer as a specific diagnostic tool, as well as for similar analyses in different fields of foam dynamics and material sciences.</div>
