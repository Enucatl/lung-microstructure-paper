<div>A wide range of pulmonary diseases affect the lungs microstructure, i.e. the alveolar epithelium, where diffusion-driven gas exchange takes place.&nbsp; Thereby, early and definite diagnosis is not only important to prevent treatment delays, but also to counteract  acute exacerbation and initiate treatment before reaching an irreversible state. In a number of works, dark-field grating interferometry has been identified as the most promising technique in the screening of disease-induced changes to the lungs microstucture, most importantly in the early diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema. Particularly the dependency of the small-angle scattering (dark-field signal) on the mean alveolar size has the potential to improve diagnosis. However, it has also been shown that the dark- is strongly biased and system-dependent when acquired on a conventional X-ray tube. In the present work, we present a full quantitative frameworkshow a quantitative model for dark-field radiography on a laboratory source, starting from first principles and a ground truth provided by microscopic tomography of the same samples. This provides a deeper understanding of dark-field imaging that can be beneficial for the design of an interferometer as a specific diagnostic tool, as well as for similar analyses in different fields of foam dynamics and material sciences.</div>
