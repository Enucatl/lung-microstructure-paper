<div>Grating interferometry has been shown to improve the diagnostic capabilities of X-ray radiography in earlier stages of emphysema when compared to traditional transmission radiography. In this work, we combine data from microscopic tomography and radiography on a laboratory source grating interferometer to&nbsp;</div>
