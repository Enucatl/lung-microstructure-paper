<div>A wide range of pulmonary diseases affect the lungs microstructure, the alveolar epithelium, whe Grating interferometry has been shown to improve the diagnostic capabilities of X-ray radiography in earlier stages of emphysema when compared to traditional transmission radiography. In this work, we show a quantitative model for dark-field radiography on a laboratory source, starting from first principles and a ground truth provided by microscopic tomography of the same samples. This provides a deeper understanding of dark-field imaging that can be beneficial for the design of an interferometer as a specific diagnostic tool, as well as for similar analyses in different fields of foam dynamics and material sciences.</div>
