\subsection{Sample preparation}
Eight \emph{ex-vivo} mouse samples were prepared at the university of Bern.
In order to preserve the delicate structure of the lungs, critical point
drying is used in order to avoid the damage caused by evaporating the liquids
from the sample in ordinary pressure conditions.

\subsection{Image acquisition}\label{sec:acquisition}
The high-resolution microtomographic 3D image data were acquired at the X02DA
TOMCAT beamline of the Swiss Light Source at the Paul Scherrer Institute
(Villigen, Switzerland). The X-ray beam was generated with a 2.9 T superbending
magnet from electrons at an energy of 2.4 GeV with synchrotron ring current of 400 mA in top-up mode. A monochromatic X-ray energy of 11 keV was tuned with a double-multilayer monochromator. After penetrating the sample, a 20 μm thick scintillator (LuAg:Ce) was used to convert the X-rays into visible light and combined with a 10x magifying objective to yield an effective pixel size of $0.65 \times 0.65$
μm$^2$. A scientific CMOS detector (pco.Edge 5.5) was used with an exposure time of 100 ms for each tomographic projections and a total of 1801 projections. A sample-to-detector distance of approximately 10 mm was employed to yield a good compromise between contrast and spatial resolution and, prior to tomographic reconstruction, phase retrieval was conducted from single defocused images using a transport-of-intensity approximation as originally proposed by Paganin et al. \cite

The radiographies on the laboratory source were taken on a symmetric
Talbot-Lau interferometer (see fig.~\ref{248327}) with a grating pitch of 5.4 μm and an intergrating
distance of 26 cm, the phase-shift grating provides a phase shift of $\pi$
at 45 keV. The average visibility of the interference pattern without any
sample is 14\%. The source is a Comet MXR-225/26 X-ray tube operated at 100
kV and 6 mA. The source size is 1 mm. The detector is a prototype based on
Santid CdTe by Dectris Ltd. The CdTe 750 μm sensor provides high quantum
efficiency at high energies (>90\% at 60 keV) with a pixel size of 75 x 75
μm$^2$. The phase-stepping procedure was performed with 31 phase steps with
1 s exposure per step.
