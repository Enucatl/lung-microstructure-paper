  abstract = {In grating-based x-ray phase sensitive imaging, dark-field contrast refers to the extinction of the interference fringes due to small-angle scattering. For configurations where the sample is placed before the beamsplitter grating, the dark-field contrast has been quantified with theoretical wave propagation models. Yet when the grating is placed before the sample, the dark-field contrast has only been modeled in the geometric optics regime. Here we attempt to quantify the dark-field effect in the grating-before-sample geometry with first-principle wave calculations and understand the associated particle-size selectivity. We obtain an expression for the dark-field effect in terms of the sample material\&\#x2019;s complex refractive index, which can be verified experimentally without fitting parameters. A dark-field computed tomography experiment shows that the particle-size selectivity can be used to differentiate materials of identical x-ray absorption.},

Its imaging principle is described in detail, and imaging results obtained for a cancerous rabbit liver and a mouse tail with synchrotron radiation are presented. Because an amplitude grating is needed to construct an X-ray Talbot interferometer, a high-aspect-ratio grating pattern was fabricated by X-ray lithography and gold electroplating. X-ray Talbot interferometry has an advantage that it functions with polychromatic cone-beam X-rays. Finally, the compatibility with a compact X-ray source is discussed.},

  abstract = {First Talbot interferometry in the hard X-ray region was demonstrated using a pair of transmission gratings made by forming gold stripes on glass plates. By aligning the gratings on the optical axis of X-rays with a separation that caused the Talbot effect by the first grating, moiré fringes were produced inclining one grating slightly against the other around the optical axis. A phase object placed in front of the first grating was detected by moiré-fringe bending. Using the technique of phase-shifting interferometry, the differential phase corresponding to the phase object could also be measured. This result suggests that X-ray Talbot interferometry is a novel and simple method for phase-sensitive X-ray radiography.},

The method is mechanically robust, requires little spatial coherence and monochromaticity, and can be scaled up to large fields of view, with a detector of correspondingly moderate spatial resolution. These are important prerequisites for use with laboratory X-ray sources.},

Chest computed tomography (CT) scanning is an essential component of the evaluation, demonstrating the presence of emphysema and its amount and distribution. Clinical experience has shown that a substantial minority of chest CT scans will also demonstrate pulmonary nodules, some of which represent lung cancers. Published series, including the National Emphysema Treatment Trial, consistently demonstrate that patients with upper lobe predominant or heterogeneous emphysema are most likely to benefit from LVRS. Heterogeneity and distribution can also be assessed by radionuclide ventilation perfusion scanning, but this modality adds little additional information to CT scanning.},

Combined with the absorption-based image, the dark-field signal enables better discrimination between healthy and emphysematous lung tissue in a mouse model. All measurements have been performed at 36 keV using a monochromatic laser-driven miniature synchrotron X-ray source (Compact Light Source). In this paper we present grating-based dark-field images of emphysematous vs. healthy lung tissue, where the strong dependence of the dark-field signal on mean alveolar size leads to improved diagnosis of emphysema in lung radiographs.},

  abstract = {Adult bone diseases, especially osteoporosis, lead to increased risk of fracture which in turn is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and financial costs. Clinically, osteoporosis is defined by low bone mineral density; however, increasing evidence suggests that the microarchitectural quality of trabecular bone (TB) is an important determinant of bone strength and fracture risk. Accurate measures of TB thickness and marrow spacing is of significant interest for early diagnosis of osteoporosis or treatment effects. Here, we present a new robust algorithm for computing TB thickness and marrow spacing at a low resolution achievable in vivo. The method uses a star-line tracing technique that effectively deals with partial voluming effects of in vivo imaging with voxel size comparable to TB thickness. Also, the method avoids the problem of digitization associated with conventional algorithms based on sampling distance transform along skeletons. Accuracy of the method was examined using computer-generated phantom images, while the robustness of the method was evaluated on human ankle specimens in terms of stability across a wide range of voxel sizes, repeat scan reproducibility under in vivo conditions, and correlation between thickness values computed at ex vivo and in vivo imaging resolutions. Also, the sensitivity of the method was examined by evaluating its ability to predict the bone strength of cadaveric specimens. Finally, the method was evaluated in a human study involving 40 healthy young-adult volunteers (age: 19-21 years; 20 males and 20 females) and ten athletes (age: 19- 21 years; six males and four females). Across a wide range of voxel sizes, the new method is significantly more accurate and robust as compared to conventional methods. Both TB thickness and marrow spacing measures computed using the new method demonstrated strong associations (R2 ∈ [0.83, 0.87]) with bone streng- h. Also, the TB thickness and marrow spacing measures allowed discrimination between male and female volunteers (p ∈ [0.01, 0.04]) as well as between athletes and nonathletes (p ∈ [0.005, 0.03]).},

Efficient data handling and post-processing is, however, difficult when the data rates are close to 10GBs${\sp {$-$}1}$. This bottleneck still hinders exploitation of the full potential inherent in the ultrafast acquisition speed. In this paper the fast reconstruction algorithm {\it gridrec}, highly optimized for conventional CPU technology, is presented. It is shown that {\it gridrec} is a valuable alternative to standard filtered back-projection routines, despite being based on the Fourier transform method. In fact, the regridding procedure used for resampling the Fourier space from polar to Cartesian coordinates couples excellent performance with negligible accuracy degradation. The stronger dependence of the observed signal-to-noise ratio for {\it gridrec} reconstructions on the number of angular views makes the presented algorithm even superior to filtered back-projection when the tomographic problem is well sampled. {\it Gridrec} not only guarantees high-quality results but it provides up to 20-fold performance increase, making real-time monitoring of the sub-second acquisition process a reality.},
